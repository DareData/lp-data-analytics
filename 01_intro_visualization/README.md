# Basics of Visualization 

**In today's world, data has become the backbone of decision-making in almost every sector.** However, understanding data can be challenging, especially if it's in large quantities or complex. 
<br>
<br>
This is where data visualization comes in handy! Data visualization is the representation of data in a graphical or pictorial format, making it easier to analyze, comprehend, and communicate. By converting data into visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization helps individuals and organizations make sense of complex information and discover patterns that may not be easily noticeable in raw data.

And, of course, you'll learn how to draw pie charts.

# Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a popular Python package used for creating data visualizations. It provides a variety of tools for creating different types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms, among others. Matplotlib is not only flexible and easy to use, but it is also highly customizable, making it a go-to tool for data visualization in various industries, including finance, engineering, and scientific research.

Overall, Matplotlib is a flexible tool for creating data data visualization in Python. You can use matplotlib in a modular way to craft some interesting plots.

On the downside, Matplotlib may be a bit convoluted for more advanced visualizations. Critics particularly point out that you need to write a lot of code to add small things to your plot such as annotations, data labels or others.

With that said, it's more important in this stage that you know how to plot the types of graphs you desire rather than focusing to make all charts super pretty, you'll have time to focus on that later on this course, trust us 😄 

Regarding videos, [Corey Schafer's](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms) series on Matplotlib contains just the right amount of information that you need to develop some interesting plots - we recommend that you watch all the videos, but knowing that that might be a bit overwhelming, we've highlighted the most important ones below.

## Part 1 - Creating and Customizing First Plots (00:35)

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_), Corey highlights the most important topics related to matplotlib and explains the modular approach of the library.

## Part 7 - Scatter Plots (00:21)

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZZ_RCwp49g&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_&index=7), Corey addresses scatter plot and how to spice them up using Matplotlib.

## Part 8 - Time Series Data (00:17)

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LWjaAiKaf8&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_&index=8), Corey shows some time series plots, addressing date time formats and helping us make sense of these types of plots inside matplotlib.

Having watched the video, head over to the `Matplotlib Examples.ipynb` and run the code top to bottom. After exploring it, we've prepared the Matplotlib quiz.
